The Actuator is the component responsible for connecting to the underlying
infrastructure and triggering the commands or API calls that allocate or
deallocate resources, based on other component's (normally the Controller)
requests.

    '''
        Sets the amount of allocated resources to the given instances, using
        the given values of caps. This method expects a dictionary of format:

        {

            "instance_id_2":cap_value_2
        }

        Normally used when executing an application.
