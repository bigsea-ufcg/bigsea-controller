The Controller is the component responsible for, based on metrics of infrastructure and application
health such as application progress and CPU usage, taking actions to ensure compliance with
quality of service levels.

class Controller:

        Creates a Controller instance.

        app_id is the id of the application associated with the instance.

        Starts scaling for the application associated
        with the controller instance. The method is not expected
        to return until the scaling is stopped through the
        stop_application_scaling. Normally, this method is used
        as a run method by a thread.

        side effect is to make start_application_scaling to return.
