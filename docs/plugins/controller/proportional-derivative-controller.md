# Controller plugin - "proportional_derivative"

## Start Scaling
### Expected parameters
* **check_interval**: Time between application state checks, in seconds. The controller checks the application state every check_interval seconds.
* **trigger_down**: The absolute value of the difference between job progress and time progress that triggers the scale down.
* **trigger_up**: The absolute value of the difference between job progress and time progress that triggers the scale up. 
* **min_cap**: The minimum possible value of resources that can be allocated to the application. Must be in range [0,100].
* **max_cap**: The maximum possible value of resources that can be allocated to the application. Must be in range [0,100].
* **metric_rounding**: The amount of decimal digits considered when taking scaling decisions. e.g.:If the scaler gets a metric value 0.567 from the metric source and metric_rounding = 2 then the value the scaler will use is 0.57.
* **heuristic_options**: Options for the heuristic used in the controller. Must contain at least "heuristic-name".
